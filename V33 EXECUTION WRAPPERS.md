1. For Single-Shot Execution
Stage 1 (Inventory Ledger):

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
PIPELINE EXECUTION INSTRUCTION - STAGE 1 (SINGLE-SHOT)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
You are currently operating in: MODE 3 (MASTER / SINGLE-SHOT).
No child contracts are supplied. The attached source represents the complete analytical scope.

Orchestrator Node Context:
ORCHESTRATOR_NODE_ID: <INJECT_UNIQUE_ID_HERE>

Execute PHASE 1 ONLY using the strict TWO-PASS BEHAVIORAL DISCOVERY process.
Apply the ATOMIC INVENTORY IDENTITY TEST. Do not consolidate during Stage 1.
Analyze the attached source and print the complete Source-Behavior Accounting Ledger as a Markdown table.

The table MUST contain these exact columns:
| Inventory ID (INV-<ORCHESTRATOR_NODE_ID>-<id>) | Observable Behavior | Trigger / Context | Source Line Ranges | Primary Behavioral Classification | Planned Primary Artifact Type | Planned Target Artifact ID | Planned Disposition (Mapped / Explicitly Omitted) | Scenario Membership (FS-SCN-<n> / MULTIPLE:<FS-SCN-<n>, ...> / NOT-SCENARIO-DISTINCT) |

Rules:
1. Use these Primary Behavioral Classification values: FLOW, BUSINESS RULE, EXCEPTION, DATA CONTRACT, SQL_MAPPING, INTEGRATION, MISSING IMPLEMENTATION, ANOMALY, UNRESOLVED EVIDENCE, NON_BEHAVIORAL TECHNICAL.
2. Pre-Planning Rule Audit: Before assigning a Planned Target Artifact ID of FS-BRL-*, validate that the behavior adds independent policy content. If it is merely passive data movement or flow sequence, plan it for Section 8 or Section 4 instead.
3. Each Stage 1 Observable Behavior cell must explicitly state, where applicable: input, trigger, condition, transformation/filter/calculation, and outcome. The Trigger/Context column must not be used as a substitute for the behavior's condition or outcome.
4. Do NOT include summary or meta-accounting rows inside the ledger table itself.
5. If the table exceeds token limits, break cleanly at a row boundary and emit: [CONTINUATION REQUIRED - NEXT: <Inventory ID>].

Immediately after the table is complete, print exactly one accounting line:
STAGE 1 ACCOUNTING: Total Inventoried: <n> | Planned Mapped: <n> | Planned Explicitly Omitted: <n> | Unaccounted: 0

Do NOT generate Sections 1-12.
Do NOT generate Appendices A-B.
Stop immediately after printing the footer.


Stage 2 (FSD Generation & Closure):
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
PIPELINE EXECUTION INSTRUCTION - STAGE 2 (SINGLE-SHOT)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Now, using EXACTLY the Source-Behavior Accounting Ledger you printed in Stage 1 as your strict baseline, generate the COMPLETE FINAL FUNCTIONAL SPECIFICATION (Sections 1-12 and Appendices A-B).

Requirements for Stage 2:
1. Stage 1 inventory IDs, source ranges, internal provenance, and mapped/omitted dispositions are immutable. Every single item from the Stage 1 table must be accounted for with zero items dropped.
2. Apply the CENTRAL CONSOLIDATION INVARIANT and STAGE 2 CONSOLIDATION PROOF. Ensure any Stage 2 consolidation preserves complete semantics and avoids generic suppression.
3. Track exact deduplicated identifiers from the Stage 1 table via the internal PROVENANCE array, but render ONLY the deduplicated source coordinates into the printed RANGES array (`<!-- TRACE: [...] -->`).
4. Pre-Generation Rule Audit: Before emitting Section 5, validate every proposed FS-BRL. If it is merely a field copy, object assignment, null-substitution, enum conversion, SQL binding, or duplicates an FS-MPF with no additional policy content, reclassify the item to Section 8 or Section 4 and DO NOT create the FS-BRL. 
5. Routing Corrections: If any routing target was altered from Stage 1, you must emit the `ROUTING CORRECTION DISCLOSURE` ledger as Section 11.5 before the Final Validation Checklist.
6. Omission Routing (Invariant 3): Materialize items into Section 11.1, 11.2, or 11.3 exactly according to ACCOUNTING DISPOSITION SEMANTICS.
7. Single-Shot Section 11.4 Rule: Section 11.4 must contain exactly: "N/A - Single-Shot Execution (Governed by Stage 1 Source-Behavior Ledger)."
8. Close the accounting loop in the Completeness Signature by verifying:
   - Total Inventoried Source Behaviors (Stage 1) = Mapped + Explicitly Omitted + Unaccounted (Must be 0).
   - Flow Projection Anti-Gaming: (1) Locked Flow-Relevant + Flow-Exempt MUST equal Total Mapped `INV-*` items from Stage 1. (2) Locked and Exempt sets MUST be mutually exclusive. (3) The Locked set MUST exactly equal the distinct set of `INV-*` items projected to Section 4.2. (4) Every Exempt reason strictly passes its evidence test.
   - Total Ingested BHV Contracts must be explicitly logged as "N/A".
   - Total BHV Disposition Ledger Rows must be explicitly logged as "N/A - Single-Shot Mode".
   Ensure the stated Total Inventoried count matches the Stage 1 Accounting footer literal count.



2. For Mode 1 (Leaf / Child - Generates BHV Contract)
Stage 1 (Leaf Inventory):

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
PIPELINE EXECUTION INSTRUCTION - STAGE 1 (MODE 1 LEAF)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
You are currently operating in: MODE 1 (LEAF / CHILD).

Orchestrator Node Context:
ORCHESTRATOR_NODE_ID: <INJECT_UNIQUE_ID_HERE>

Execute PHASE 1 ONLY using the strict TWO-PASS BEHAVIORAL DISCOVERY process.
Apply the ATOMIC INVENTORY IDENTITY TEST. Do not consolidate during Stage 1.
Analyze the attached raw source and print the Leaf Source-Behavior Accounting Ledger as a Markdown table. Do NOT assign final FS-* IDs in this mode.

The table MUST contain these exact columns:
| Inventory ID (INV-<ORCHESTRATOR_NODE_ID>-<id>) | Observable Behavior | Trigger / Context | Source Line Ranges | Primary Behavioral Classification | Planned Primary Artifact Type | Planned Target Destination | Planned Disposition (Mapped to BHV / Explicitly Omitted) | Scenario Membership (LOCAL-SCN-<ORCHESTRATOR_NODE_ID>-<n> / MULTIPLE:<LOCAL-SCN-<ORCHESTRATOR_NODE_ID>-<n>, ...> / NOT-SCENARIO-DISTINCT) |

Rules:
1. Use these Primary Behavioral Classification values: FLOW, BUSINESS RULE, EXCEPTION, DATA CONTRACT, SQL_MAPPING, INTEGRATION, MISSING IMPLEMENTATION, ANOMALY, UNRESOLVED EVIDENCE, NON_BEHAVIORAL TECHNICAL.
2. Pre-Planning Rule Audit: Before assigning a Planned Target Destination of FS-BRL, validate that the behavior adds independent policy content. If it is merely passive data movement or flow sequence, plan it for Section 8 or Section 4 instead.
3. Each Stage 1 Observable Behavior cell must explicitly state, where applicable: input, trigger, condition, transformation/filter/calculation, and outcome. The Trigger/Context column must not be used as a substitute for the behavior's condition or outcome.
4. Do NOT include summary or meta-accounting rows inside the ledger table itself.
5. If the table exceeds token limits, break cleanly at a row boundary and emit: [CONTINUATION REQUIRED - NEXT: <Inventory ID>].

Immediately after the table is complete, print exactly one accounting line:
STAGE 1 ACCOUNTING: Total Inventoried: <n> | Planned Mapped: <n> | Planned Explicitly Omitted: <n> | Unaccounted: 0

Do NOT generate the Behavioral Contract yet. Stop immediately after printing the footer.


Stage 2 (Contract Generation):
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
PIPELINE EXECUTION INSTRUCTION - STAGE 2 (MODE 1 LEAF)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Now, using EXACTLY the Leaf Source-Behavior Accounting Ledger you printed in Stage 1 as your strict baseline, generate the complete structured CHILD BEHAVIORAL CONTRACT using the 9-part Behavioral Contract Schema.

Requirements for Stage 2:
1. Stage 1 inventory IDs, source ranges, internal provenance, and mapped/omitted dispositions are immutable. Every mapped behavior from the Stage 1 table must be explicitly represented in the appropriate Behavioral Contract schema field according to its classification. You may correct the routing destination if the Quality Gate dictates, but do not force a behavior into Schema Item 2 or 3 when its classification belongs to another schema field.
2. Apply the CENTRAL CONSOLIDATION INVARIANT and STAGE 2 CONSOLIDATION PROOF. Ensure any Stage 2 consolidation preserves complete semantics and avoids generic suppression.
3. Routing Corrections: If any routing destination was altered from Stage 1, emit the `ROUTING CORRECTION DISCLOSURE` ledger after Schema Item 9.
4. Omission Routing (Invariant 3): Materialize items into Behavioral Contract Schema items 7 or 8 exactly according to ACCOUNTING DISPOSITION SEMANTICS.
5. Conclude by re-verifying that 100% of rows in the Stage 1 table are accounted for with zero unaccounted omissions. Ensure the stated Total Inventoried count matches the Stage 1 Accounting footer literal count.
6. Scenario Preservation: Explicitly carry the Scenario Membership value(s) from the Stage 1 table into Behavioral Contract Schema item 9, preserving MULTIPLE:<...> groupings where present.


3. For Mode 2 (Parent / Intermediate - Generates BHV Contract)
Stage 1 (Reconciliation Ledger):

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
PIPELINE EXECUTION INSTRUCTION - STAGE 1 (MODE 2 PARENT)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
You are currently operating in: MODE 2 (PARENT / INTERMEDIATE).

Orchestrator Node Context:
ORCHESTRATOR_NODE_ID: <INJECT_UNIQUE_ID_HERE>

Execute PHASE 1 ONLY using the strict TWO-PASS BEHAVIORAL DISCOVERY process.
Apply the ATOMIC INVENTORY IDENTITY TEST. Do not consolidate during Stage 1.
Analyze the attached Parent source code AND reconcile it against all supplied direct-child Behavioral Contracts.
Apply Invariant 4: Stitch cross-chunk boundary logic across the parent-child interfaces before defining behaviors. Do NOT assign final FS-* IDs in this mode.

Print the Parent-Child Reconciled Behavioral Ledger as a Markdown table containing these exact columns:
| Inventory ID (INV-<ORCHESTRATOR_NODE_ID>-<id>) | Originating Entity (Parent Source / Child Contract ID) | Observable Behavior & Integration Effect | Source Line Ranges / Child Provenance | Primary Behavioral Classification | Planned Primary Artifact Type | Planned Target Destination | Planned Disposition (Mapped to Parent BHV / Absorbed / Omitted) | Scenario Membership (preserve existing LOCAL-SCN-* from child contracts and parent-local LOCAL-SCN-<ORCHESTRATOR_NODE_ID>-<n> / MULTIPLE:<...> / NOT-SCENARIO-DISTINCT) |

Rules:
1. Use the standard Primary Behavioral Classification values.
2. Pre-Planning Rule Audit: Before assigning a Planned Target Destination of FS-BRL, validate that the behavior adds independent policy content. If it is merely passive data movement or flow sequence, plan it for Section 8 or Section 4 instead.
3. Each Stage 1 Observable Behavior cell must explicitly state, where applicable: input, trigger, condition, transformation/filter/calculation, and outcome. The Originating Entity or context column must not be used as a substitute for the behavior's condition or outcome.
4. Scenario Union: You MUST carry forward and union all LOCAL-SCN-* scenario memberships from child behaviors contributing to the reconciled Parent behavior (including child behaviors classified as Mapped to Parent BHV or Absorbed) with any parent-local scenario memberships in the Parent's Scenario Membership column.
5. Parent Inventory Lineage: Cross-mode reconciliation may create a new Parent INV-* identity when multiple upstream fragments collectively constitute the same atomic parent-level observable behavior under the ATOMIC INVENTORY IDENTITY TEST. You MUST NOT merge independently observable upstream behaviors into one Parent INV-* identity. Multiple upstream INV-* items may contribute to one Parent INV-* only when they are fragments of the same atomic parent-level observable behavior. All contributing upstream INV-* identities, observable semantics, evidence, and source ranges MUST remain explicitly recoverable. Upstream INV-* identities remain immutable and are not replaced.
6. Do NOT include summary or meta-accounting rows inside the ledger table itself.
7. If the table exceeds token limits, break cleanly at a row boundary and emit: [CONTINUATION REQUIRED - NEXT: <Inventory ID>].

Immediately after the table is complete, print exactly one accounting line:
STAGE 1 ACCOUNTING: Total Reconciled Behaviors: <n> | Planned Mapped: <n> | Planned Absorbed: <n> | Planned Explicitly Omitted: <n> | Unaccounted: 0

Do NOT generate the Parent Behavioral Contract yet. Stop immediately after printing the footer.

Stage 2 (Parent Contract Assembly):

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
PIPELINE EXECUTION INSTRUCTION - STAGE 2 (MODE 2 PARENT)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Now, using EXACTLY the Reconciled Behavioral Ledger from Stage 1 as your strict baseline, generate the complete structured PARENT BEHAVIORAL CONTRACT using the 9-part Behavioral Contract Schema.

Requirements for Stage 2:
1. Execute Invariant 1 (Universal Provenance Retention & Union): For all absorbed or merged child behaviors, compute the exact set-theoretic union of child coordinates for RANGES and preserve their provenance IDs internally.
2. Stage 1 inventory IDs, source ranges, internal provenance, and mapped/absorbed/omitted dispositions are immutable. You may correct the final artifact routing destination if the Quality Gate dictates. Ensure all child-driven control flows and local parent behaviors from the Stage 1 table are represented.
3. Apply the CENTRAL CONSOLIDATION INVARIANT and STAGE 2 CONSOLIDATION PROOF. Ensure any Stage 2 consolidation preserves complete semantics and avoids generic suppression.
4. Routing Corrections: If any routing destination was altered from Stage 1, emit the `ROUTING CORRECTION DISCLOSURE` ledger after Schema Item 9.
5. Omission Routing (Invariant 3): Materialize items into Behavioral Contract Schema items 7 or 8 exactly according to ACCOUNTING DISPOSITION SEMANTICS.
6. Conclude with a verification statement confirming all Stage 1 items are fully accounted for. Ensure the stated Total Reconciled Behaviors and Absorbed counts match the Stage 1 Accounting footer.
7. Scenario Preservation: Explicitly carry the Scenario Membership value(s) from the Stage 1 table into Behavioral Contract Schema item 9, preserving MULTIPLE:<...> groupings where present.


4. For Mode 3 (Master Finalization with Chunks - Generates Final FSD)
Stage 1 (Dual-Ledger Reconciliation):

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
PIPELINE EXECUTION INSTRUCTION - STAGE 1 (MODE 3 MASTER)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
You are currently operating in: MODE 3 (MASTER / CHUNKS).

Orchestrator Node Context:
ORCHESTRATOR_NODE_ID: <INJECT_UNIQUE_ID_HERE>

Execute PHASE 1 ONLY using the strict TWO-PASS BEHAVIORAL DISCOVERY process. You must analyze the attached Master entry-point source code AND ingest the full manifest of supplied child/parent BHV contracts.
Apply the ATOMIC INVENTORY IDENTITY TEST to local behaviors. Do not consolidate during Stage 1.

Print TWO separate planning tables:

TABLE 1: Master Local Source-Behavior Ledger
(Cataloging observable behavior located directly in the Master source code)
| Local Inventory ID (INV-<ORCHESTRATOR_NODE_ID>-<id>) | Observable Behavior | Trigger / Context | Source Line Ranges | Primary Behavioral Classification | Planned Primary Artifact Type | Planned Target Artifact ID | Planned Disposition (Mapped / Explicitly Omitted) | Scenario Membership (FS-SCN-<n> / MULTIPLE:<FS-SCN-<n>, ...> / NOT-SCENARIO-DISTINCT) |

TABLE 2: Ingested BHV Input Disposition Ledger (Section 11.4 Planning)
(Reconciling every supplied BHV contract from downstream chunks)
| BHV Source Node ID | Contributing Component / Class | Planned Disposition (Mapped / Absorbed / Omitted) | Planned Target Destination(s) | Reconciled Line Ranges (Union Applied) | Justification / Override Reason |

Rules:
1. For Table 1, use the standard Primary Behavioral Classification values.
2. Pre-Planning Rule Audit: Before assigning a Planned Target Artifact ID of FS-BRL-* in Table 1, validate that the behavior adds independent policy content.
3. Each Stage 1 Observable Behavior cell (in Table 1) must explicitly state, where applicable: input, trigger, condition, transformation/filter/calculation, and outcome. The Trigger/Context column must not be used as a substitute for the behavior's condition or outcome.
4. For Table 2, Master may evaluate the full BHV contract content to determine if a child's provisional classification must be overridden and log the justification in the final column.
5. Do NOT include summary or meta-accounting rows inside the ledger tables themselves.
6. Apply Invariant 4 across chunk boundaries.
7. If either table exceeds token limits, break cleanly at a row boundary and emit: [CONTINUATION REQUIRED - NEXT: <Table / ID>].

Immediately after the tables are complete, print exactly one accounting line:
STAGE 1 ACCOUNTING: Local Inventoried: <n> | Local Mapped: <n> | Local Explicitly Omitted: <n> | Local Unaccounted: 0 | Ingested BHVs: <n> | BHV Mapped: <n> | BHV Absorbed: <n> | BHV Omitted: <n> | BHV Unaccounted: 0

Do NOT generate Sections 1-12 or Appendices yet. Stop immediately after printing the footer.


Stage 2 (Final FSD Assembly & Closure):

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
PIPELINE EXECUTION INSTRUCTION - STAGE 2 (MODE 3 MASTER)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Now, using BOTH Table 1 (Local Source Ledger) and Table 2 (BHV Disposition Ledger) from Stage 1 as your strict completeness baselines, generate the COMPLETE FINAL FUNCTIONAL SPECIFICATION (Sections 1-12 and Appendices A-B).

Requirements for Stage 2:
1. Every local behavior from Table 1 and every BHV contract from Table 2 must be fully accounted for and integrated into the document according to their planned dispositions. 
2. Stage 1 inventory IDs, source ranges, internal provenance, and accounting dispositions (Mapped/Absorbed/Omitted) are immutable. You may correct the final artifact routing destination if the Quality Gate dictates. 
3. Apply the CENTRAL CONSOLIDATION INVARIANT and STAGE 2 CONSOLIDATION PROOF. Ensure any Stage 2 consolidation preserves complete semantics and avoids generic suppression.
4. Routing Corrections: If any routing destination was altered from Table 1, emit the `ROUTING CORRECTION DISCLOSURE` ledger as Section 11.5 before the Final Validation Checklist.
5. In Section 11.4, emit the finalized BHV Input Disposition Ledger matching Table 2.
6. Ensure all inline `<!-- TRACE: [...] -->` tags respect Invariant 1: deduplicated source coordinates ONLY. `PROVENANCE` mapping is maintained internally for accounting but must NOT be printed in the tags.
7. Pre-Generation Rule Audit: Validate every proposed FS-BRL. If it does not add independent policy content beyond data mapping or flow sequence, correct its routing to Section 8 or Section 4.
8. Omission Routing (Invariant 3): Route any Table 1 Explicitly Omitted items correctly according to ACCOUNTING DISPOSITION SEMANTICS.
9. Execute the Final Validation Checklist and print the full Completeness Signature, explicitly proving:
   - Total Inventoried Source Behaviors (Table 1) = Mapped + Omitted + Unaccounted (Must be 0).
   - Flow Projection Anti-Gaming: (1) Locked Flow-Relevant + Flow-Exempt MUST equal the complete flattened set of Mapped local (Table 1) and recursively inherited (Table 2) `INV-*` identities. (2) Locked and Exempt sets MUST be mutually exclusive. (3) The Locked set MUST exactly equal the distinct set of `INV-*` items projected to Section 4.2. (4) Every Exempt reason strictly passes its evidence test.
   - Ensure the stated Total Inventoried and Ingested counts match the Stage 1 Accounting footer.
   - Total Ingested BHV Contracts (Table 2) = Mapped + Absorbed + Omitted (100% Match).
10. Scenario Resolution: Reconcile both Master-local FS-SCN-* candidates from Table 1 and ingested LOCAL-SCN-* memberships from the supplied BHV contracts into a unified final FS-SCN-* scenario catalogue. Merge them if they represent the same observable end-to-end path/outcome.
